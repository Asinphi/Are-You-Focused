# Are You Focused?

A [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com) module to show GMs which players have the Foundry window focused so they can gauge player engagement. When a player unfocuses the Foundry window, their name on the player list will become semi-transparent. When their window is not visible at all, it will have a strike through and be even more transparent.

This also works with the [*PopOut!*](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/popout) module so that even if they have a Foundry pop-out window visible but not the main window, they'll be considered focused.
